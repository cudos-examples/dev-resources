# Decentralised Exchange with ERC-20 CUDOS Tokens
> ℹ️ This exchange supports the CUDOS token on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20).

> ℹ️ We suggest using a computer for this, some of the steps are unsupported on mobile.

You should be able to find the CUDOS token in the "Swap" or "Trade" section of this exchange application.
Once you have traded for CUDOS on the platform, the next steps are: bridge the tokens to the Cudos blockchain, and then be able to interact with dApps and features on the Cudos blockchain.

1. Create a Cudos address if you don't have one already. A Cudos address will begin with `cudos1`. To create a new address, [these instructions](../minidoc/keplr-create.md) will help you get set up with Keplr wallet. 
> ℹ️ The Cosmos ecosystem, which Cudos is a part of, uses different wallets to Ethereum, Keplr and Cosmostation are the most common.
2. Use the [Cudos Bridge](https://bridge.cudos.org/) to move your CUDOS tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to the Cudos blockchain.
> ℹ️ To bridge, you will connect both your Metamask wallet to the Ethereum side of the transaction, and your Keplr wallet to the Cudos side of the transaction and the bridge will move the specified number of tokens from one chain to another.
3. Once the bridge transaction has completed, you will now see your funds sitting in your Keplr/Cosmostation wallet when the `CudosNetwork` is selected.

**Congratulations! You have Mainnet CUDOS tokens!**

Now what?

You can now interact with dApps built on Cudos, buy computing with CUDOS tokens, purchase tokenised infrastructure NFTs, vote on governance proposals, and stake to earn a passive income on your tokens!
